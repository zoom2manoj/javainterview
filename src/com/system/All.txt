Main Advantage of using String.
various implementations of Collection.
various implementations of map
treemap vs hashmap
internal implementations of hashmap and treemap
why map is not part of collection
collection hierarchy
Special property of String in java.
Why map is a part of collection stil it is not extended by collection
What is collection.

meaning of public and static in main method
overloading and overriding
searching and sorting in array algo/Complexity
implementation of arrayList
HashTable vs HashMap
LinkedList vs ArrayList
where we use arraylist and where we use linkedlist.
Why string is immutable in Java.

Difference Between ArrayList and Vector
HashSet vs HashTable
Various Implementations of List
Stack
Set
Sorting in set
HashCode
HashMap
Scnearios for using ArrayList and LinkedList
for reversing a list of characters which one is used.
If there is a method which is threadsafe(multithread Environment) in what scenarios which one is better either arrayList or LinedList.
How we can iterate HashMap

Suppose that there are two objects of Employee class e1 and e2.
Employee object contains id and name.

// Core Java

how we can sort a collection.
set vs Sortedset vs treeset
treemap
load properties file / dynamic 
StringBuilder and StringBuffer
static varibales
Factory Pattern
Why we use Singleton
stateless objects
In a simple method if we create a object and 10 thread are using that object
than how many total objects are created.
Scope of object

what would happen if we call destroy method from service.
How to make a class immutable.
composition vs Aggregation
Encapsulation vs Abstarction

what are design patterns.
Difference between factory and abstract factory design pattern
What is singleton and factory patterns.
give me  scenario where you can use singleton.
oops features

How set maintains uniqueness.
Internal working of hashset/HashMap
Write your own GC
Create your own linked list
String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder
Where we use hashMap
What is hashCode
